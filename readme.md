time taken to build this website : 3.5 days [along with media queries,javascript, active states styling]

### The challenge

- make a portfolio website
- responsive landing page depending on various device's screen size
- implement hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- implement slider to show certifications, featured projects

## My process

- writing html for a section, styling that section via css
- write js for the built html
- once whole page is built focus on active states like hover, focus etc..
- after active states , focus on media queries

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- CSS flexbox
- made responsive with media queries
- vanillajs

### What I learned

- positioning
- flexbox
- media queries
- using css variables
- using google fonts
- fontawesome icons
- implementing slider,hamburger menu via js [autoslide,manualslider]
- Order of Inclusion of style sheets:
   - **_Base Styles_**: Include base or reset stylesheets first.
   - **_Library Styles_**: Next, include stylesheets from libraries e.g., Bootstrap, Foundation).
   - **_Component Styles_**: Include styles specific to components (buttons, forms, etc.) afterward.
   - **_Custom Styles_**: Your own custom styles should come last, allowing you to override any previous styles.
- we cannot access index.html from project-cards.js so store whatever you want in localstorage on an action in index.html and access them in project-cards.js via localstorage
